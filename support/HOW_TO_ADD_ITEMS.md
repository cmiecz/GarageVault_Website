**Steps:**
1. Tap **"+"** → **"Scan Item with AI"**
2. Point camera at the item, label, or packaging
3. Take a clear photo
4. AI automatically extracts:
   - Model numbers
   - Serial numbers
   - Brand names
   - Product details
5. Review and edit the auto-filled information
6. Tap **"Save"**

**Pro Tip:** For tools and equipment, you can scan multiple photos (front, back, label) for better detail extraction!

## Tips for Effective Item Entry

### Photography Best Practices

✅ **DO:**
- Take photos in bright, natural lighting
- Capture serial number plates clearly
- Photo the original packaging/label
- Include all sides of power tools
- Photograph manuals or instruction stickers
- Show any damage or wear

❌ **DON'T:**
- Take photos in dark or shadowy areas
- Use flash (can cause glare on labels)
- Skip photographing serial numbers
- Forget to photo receipts before throwing away

### Naming Conventions

**Good Names:**
- "Milwaukee M18 Hammer Drill 2804-20"
- "Deck Screws 3-inch Torx GRK R4"
- "Sherwin Williams Naval SW 6244 - Kitchen"
- "Mobil 1 5W-30 Full Synthetic"

**Bad Names:**
- "Drill" (too vague)
- "Screws" (which size?)
- "Blue Paint" (what room? what brand?)
- "Oil" (for what?)

**Tips:**
- Include brand and model
- Add size or key spec
- For paint: include room used
- For fluids: include viscosity
- Be specific enough to distinguish from similar items

### Quantity Tracking Strategy

**Set Low Stock Thresholds For:**
- Consumables (screws, nails, paint)
- Fluids you use regularly
- Replacement parts (blades, filters)
- Items you never want to run out of

**Don't Bother Tracking Quantity For:**
- One-off tools (you have 1, you'll always have 1)
- Items you rarely use
- Non-consumables

### Organization Tips

💡 **Enter Items Immediately**
- Add items as soon as you buy them
- Use AI scanning while still in parking lot
- Scan receipt before putting it away

💡 **Batch Entry**
- Adding many items? Set aside 30 minutes
- Gather everything, take photos, enter all at once
- Use AI scanning to speed it up

💡 **Start with High-Value Items**
- Tools and equipment first (warranty, theft recovery)
- Consumables can wait
- Focus on items worth $50+

💡 **Use Consistent Storage Names**
- Name storage locations before adding items
- Use QR codes on physical storage
- Always put items in same place
